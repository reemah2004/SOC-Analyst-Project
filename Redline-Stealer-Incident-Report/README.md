Redline Stealer Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)  

This project simulates a "SOC analyst investigation" demonstrating detection of malicious traffic, C2 communication, and data exfiltration patterns using 
wireshark and Threat Intelligence tools.  

Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to replicate a real-world malware investigation workflow:  
- Identify suspicious DNS queries 
- Trace HTTP POST requests used for data exfiltration  
- Correlate TLS activity with sandbox evasion tactics  
- Extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- Document findings in a professional Incident Response Report (Identification â†’ Containment â†’ Eradication â†’ Recovery)  

Tools & Technologies  
- Wireshark â€“ Network traffic capture & packet analysis  
- VirusTotal â€“ IOC enrichment & validation  
- Windows/Linux test environment â€“ Analysis workstation
  
Key Project Steps  
- DNS Query Analysisâ†’ Identified suspicious request to `api.ip.sb`, used by malware to check external IPs  
- HTTP Traffic Analysisâ†’ Traced multiple POST requests to `188.190.10.10`, confirming exfiltration activity  
- TLS Activity Review â†’ Observed handshake with Cloudflare server, consistent with sandbox evasion behavior  
- C2 Indicatorsâ†’ Structured XML payloads with gradually increasing sizes indicated staged data theft  
- Incident Response Reporting â†’ Documented findings across Identification, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phases

Key Takeaways  
- Hands-on experience in malware traffic analysis & incident response  
- Improved ability to spot C2 communication and exfiltration patterns  
- Demonstrated use of packet analysis (Wireshark) for SOC workflows  
- Reinforced the importance of detecting and documenting exfiltration activity with IOCs

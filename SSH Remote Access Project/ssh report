Secure SSH Remote Access Project (Kali Linux & Windows 11)

This project simulates a "real-world remote administration scenario" demonstrating secure SSH access, firewall hardening, intrusion prevention, and tunneling techniques to overcome ISP restrictions.
 
Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to replicate real-world challenges in securing remote SSH access:  
- Configure and secure an OpenSSH server on Kali Linux  
- Change the default SSH port to reduce automated attack exposure  
- Implement firewall rules to restrict access  
- Deploy Fail2Ban to block brute-force attempts  
- Handle ISP restrictions with tunneling (Ngrok)  
- Simulate login failures and monitor log-based detection  

Tools & Technologies  
- Kali Linuxâ€“ OpenSSH server, UFW firewall, Fail2Ban  
- Windows 11 Pro â€“ SSH client (remote access testing)  
- Ngrok â€“ TCP tunneling service for bypassing ISP restrictions  

Key Project Steps  
- OpenSSH Configuration â†’ Installed and enabled SSH server, changed default port `22` â†’ `5711`  
- Firewall Hardening â†’ Configured UFW to allow only port `5711`  
- Fail2Ban Setup â†’ Monitored authentication logs and automatically banned repeated failed logins  
- ISP Restriction Workaround â†’ Used Ngrok TCP tunneling after discovering ISP blocks inbound connections  
- Attack Simulation â†’ Conducted failed login attempts from Windows and observed Fail2Ban detection & banning in logs

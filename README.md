 Vulnerability Assessment & SIEM Integration Project  

This project simulates a "SOC Analyst workflow", demonstrating vulnerability detection, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and remediation planning using "Nmap, Nessus, and Splunk".  

 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to replicate a real-world "Blue Team / SOC environment":  
- Perform "network reconnaissance" with Nmap  
- Run "vulnerability scans" with Nessus  
- Ingest and analyze results in **Splunk**  
- Map vulnerabilities to the "MITRE ATT&CK framework"  
- Provide "remediation recommendations" for high-risk findings  


 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Nmap– Port scanning & service enumeration  
- Nessus Essentials – Vulnerability assessment  
- Splunk– Log ingestion, dashboards, CVE analysis  
- MITRE ATT&CK – Threat technique mapping  
- Kali Linux + Metasploitable2 – Lab environment  


## 📊 Key Project Steps  
1. Nmap Scan → Identified open ports and running services on the target (Metasploitable2).  
2. Nessus Vulnerability Scan → Discovered CVEs, misconfigurations, and outdated services.  
3. Splunk Integration → Ingested Nessus & Nmap logs into Splunk for dashboarding.  
4. Dashboard Creation → Built Splunk visualizations:  
   - Top CVEs by severity  
   - Open ports exposure  
4. MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping  
6. Remediation Planning→ Suggested security fixes based on risk prioritization.

 Key Takeaways  
- Hands-on experience in "vulnerability management & SOC analysis"  
- Improved ability to "map technical findings to attacker behavior" with MITRE ATT&CK  
- Demonstrated use of "SIEM tools" (Splunk) for log correlation and reporting  
- Reinforced the importance of not just detecting vulnerabilities, but also "communicating remediation strategies"
